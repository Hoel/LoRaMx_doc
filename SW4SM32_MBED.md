## Setting up a SW4STM32 (AC6) project exported from MBED online compiler


### When an SW4STM32 project is exported from MBED online compiler few settings have to be adjusted so that the project can build:

* go to **project properties / C/C++ build / MCU GCC compiler / includes** and change includes files to point to the actual **mbed_config.h** situated at the root of project folder
* go to **project properties / C/C++ build / MCU G++ compiler / includes** and change includes files to point to the actual **mbed_config.h** situated at the root of project folder
* go to **project properties / C/C++ build / MCU G++ compiler /miscellaneous / linker flags** and remove the following flags: **-Wl,--wrap=_malloc_r -Wl,--wrap=_free_r -Wl,--wrap=_calloc_r**


### STLink connection and configuration:

On windows you should install the STLink driver, you can do so by installing the [STLink utility](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html). On Mac and Linux no driver installation is usually required.
We assume the STLink debugger is connected via **GND VCC DIO CLK**, with **reset** line omitted.
If you want to use the **reset** line change reset mode to : **hardware reset** in **debug/run configuration** as explained below. 
_N.B. unless special cases there is no need to use **reset** line, we advise to connect **GND VCC DIO CLK** only._ 


### For the first run of the project run/debug configuration has to be setup:

* Go to contextual menu of the run button (green button with arrow)
* select **run as** / **AC6 STM32 C/C++ application**
* the upload will attempt and fail because the reset mode is not set yet
* return to contextual menu of run button, select **run configuration** go to debugger tab, clic **show generator options**
* find **reset mode** and select **software reset** run button is now functional, it will compile, upload and reset board automatically


### RUN / ISP switch:

Some LoRaMx boards have a RUN / ISP DIP switch, this switch can be used in the eventuality you need to use the internal bootlader from UART since some variants only offer internal (read-only ROM) bootloader on UART (namely STM32F103, STM32L151) to do so set the RUN / ISP switch to **OFF** (ISP). In all other cases we advise to always let the RUN / ISP switch set to **ON** (RUN), this will not interfere the upload nor debug when STlink is connected and will allow full upload / debug / run.


### FAST CHARGE switch / solder jumper:

When set to **ON** the **fast charge** DIP switch allows maximum current charging to LiPo 1000mA (max), DIP switch **OFF** (default) charging current is 100mA. Some LoRaMx boards have a solder jumper instead of a DIP switch, solder jumper open charging current is 100mA when open (default) and 1000mA (max) when clsoed.
